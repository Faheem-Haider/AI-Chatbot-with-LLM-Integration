<h2>How to Deploy the Bot</h2>
<p>The bot is a conversational AI application that can engage users in natural language conversations using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. To deploy this bot, you will need to follow these steps:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Fork the Repository</h3>
<p>Start by forking the repository and making your forked repository private to protect your OpenAI and Telegram Keys (easiest fro testing).</p>
<h3>Step 2: Replace the Keys</h3>
<p>In the forked repository, edit the .py file and replace the keys with the ones you had copied.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Create a Heroku Account</h3>
<p>Register or login into your Heroku account.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Create a New Application</h3>
<p>Create a new application in Heroku, and add Python as a buildpack since the chatbot was created with Python.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Deploy the Forked Repo</h3>
<p>Under the deploy tab in Heroku, link your GitHub account and deploy the forked repo.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Configure and Turn On the Dyno</h3>
<p>Navigate to the Overview tab in Heroku and configure and turn on the dyno.</p>
